3.1.0 for 6.1.0
Released ???

    Config changes:
   * Removed useless cost option from /checktypes and /fixlevel. Old configs will still work.
   * Removed per-config versions, as they were useless. Most old configs will still work, see below.
   * New /showstats features: Super compact mode, and an alternate VIP cooldown. Redo this config.
   * New /upgradeivs features: Separate settings for shiny babies. Redo this config as well.

    New commands:
   * /fixgender: Fixes Pokémon affected by the 6.0.x breeding bug or by bad commands. Experimental!
   * /pokecure: Heals Pokémon (slot or party) on a configurable cooldown, for a configurable cost.
   * /spawndex: Spawns Pokémon from their Pokédex number. Made for testing, might be useful?

    Other changes:
   * Fixed /fixevs eating money without fixing things, if re-used on a Pokémon beyond the limits.
   * Added console support for /checkstats, /checktypes and /forcehatch. More to come?
   * Fixed "Ho-Oh" not being valid input for /checktypes.
   * Added an optional second argument to /checktypes, so names like "Tapu Koko" will work.
   * Changed max-IV formatting for stuff like /checkstats to Italic to work around an external bug.
   * Updated the command listing to also work from console, where it'll show only console commands.
   * Fixed /checkegg saying egg rechecks were free even with command cost set to 0.
   * Fixed missing spaces in front of the pipes when showing EVs in /checkstats.
   * Fixed /upgradeivs saying legendaries were shiny on debug messages.
   * Fixed /dittofusion mentioning upgrading instead of fusing in some places. Oops.
   * Made the /checkstats messages referring to /checkegg a bit more... professional.
   * Fixed a bunch of miscellaneous debug logger typos and wrong mentions.
   * Rewrote the internal config loader. Mostly useful for maintenance, but the filesize is smaller, too!
   * Changing command aliases no longer requires a reboot. Experimental.
   * Added all babies and baby-based evolutions to /upgradeivs, and edited messages to fit.
   * Added Poipole (ID 803) and up to /checktypes and the new /spawndex.
   * Fixed a lot of miscellaneous bugs, and possibly introduced a few too. As always, please report!
