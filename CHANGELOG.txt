3.1.0 beta for 6.1.0
Released ???

    Config changes:
   * Removed useless cost option from /checktypes and /fixlevel. Old configs will still work.
   * Removed per-config versions, as they were useless. Most old configs will still work, see below.
   * New /showstats features: Super compact mode, and an alternate VIP cooldown. Redo this config.
   * New /upgradeivs features: Separate settings for shiny babies. Redo this config as well.

    New commands:
   * /fixgender: Fixes Pokémon affected by the 6.0.x breeding bug or by bad commands. Experimental!
   * /pokecure: Heals Pokémon (slot or party) on a configurable cooldown, for a configurable cost.
   * /spawndex: Spawns Pokémon based on their Pokédex number. Made for testing, might be useful?

    Other changes:
   * Added Poipole (ID 803) and up to /checktypes and the new /spawndex.
   * Added all babies and baby-based evolutions to /upgradeivs, and edited messages to fit.
   * Added an optional second argument to /checktypes, so names like "Tapu Koko" will work.
   * Added console support for: /checkstats, /checktypes, /fixgenders, /forcehatch, /forcestats, /pokecure
   * Changed many command messages to be a bit more professional.
   * Changed max-IV formatting for commands like /checkstats to italic to work around an external bug.
   * Changing command aliases no longer requires a reboot. Experimental.
   * Fixed "Ho-Oh" not being valid input for /checktypes.
   * Fixed /checkegg saying rechecks are free with no price set, instead of just proceeding silently.
   * Fixed /checkstats not showing the nickname on shiny Pokémon.
   * Fixed /dittofusion mentioning upgrading instead of fusing in some places. Oops.
   * Fixed /fixevs eating money without fixing things, if re-used on a Pokémon beyond the limits.
   * Fixed /resetcount not recognizing "ALL" correctly because I forgot I never fully finished it. Derp.
   * Fixed /upgradeivs saying legendaries were shiny on debug messages.
   * Fixed a bunch of bugs that were too small to mention, mostly formatting issues.
   * Fixed missing spaces in front of the pipes when showing EVs in /checkstats.
   * Hopefully fixed /checkstats's gender/size/nature line rolling over to another line.
   * Removed a few older default aliases that weren't being shown anywhere anyways.
   * Rewrote the internal config loader. Mostly helps maintainability, but filesize also benefited.
   * Shortened many console messages to fit a standard Command Prompt window. Work in progress.
   * Updated /pixelupgrade to also work from console, where it'll show only console-accessible commands.
