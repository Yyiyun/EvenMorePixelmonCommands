4.1.0 for 6.3.0
Released ???

    Major (breaking) config changes:
   * Added a "statSeparator" option to the main config. We'll load a failsafe and warn if it's not present.

    Other changes:
   * Fixed "a blocks" typo on /fixgenders, when used from command blocks.
   * Fixed /pixelupgrade showing further messages getting hidden when run in console, even though it wouldn't.
   * Fixed /pixelupgrade console info messages showing up as "PU Info info". Oops.
   * Fixed /showstats "This Pokémon is gigantic" when "giant" is apparently perfectly valid, here.
   * Fixed configs for /showstats, /timedhatch and /timedheal showing the wrong altcooldown permissions.
   * Fixed debug logger breaking with a NullPointerException if the main config was broken.
   * Fixed missing EVSpecialDefense tag for /forcestats.
   * Some "pixelupgrade.command.staff.*" perms are now "pixelupgrade.command.other.*". Update your perms. Sorry!

4.0.0 beta 1 for 6.2.0
Released February 13th, 2018.

    Minor (non-breaking) config changes:
   * Changed a bunch of helper text to hopefully explain things a bit better.
   * Changed the default numLinesPerPage for /pixelupgrade from 20 to 10 to accomodate smaller chats.
   * Removed a few of the less useful config-set aliases. You can still set them manually.
   * Removed commandCost from /checktypes as this info is easily Googled.
   * Removed showFixEVsHelper from /checkstats as /fixevs was removed. See "Removed commands" for more info.
   * Removed per-config versions, as they turned out to be useless.

    Major (breaking) config changes:
   * Completely reworked /showstats and its config; it now uses hovers for its info. Regenerate this config.

    New commands:
   * /fixgender: Fixes Pokémon affected by breeding bugs or bad commands. Experimental!
   * /spawndex: Spawns Pokémon based on their Pokédex number. Can add neat effects, like an outline.
   * /timedhatch: Hatches eggs (slot or party) on a configurable cooldown, for a configurable cost.
   * /timedheal: Heals Pokémon (slot or party) on a configurable cooldown, for a configurable cost.

    Removed commands:
   * /fixevs: As of Reforged 6.2, EVs cap at 252 (gen 6+ cap) instead of 255, making this command obsolete.
   * /fixlevel: The bug it was made to fix (EVs not increasing when at the level cap) no longer exists.

    Experimental console support:
   * /checkstats
   * /checktypes
   * /fixgenders
   * /forcehatch (this command has become kinda useless, may be merged into /timedhatch soon)
   * /forcestats
   * /pixelupgrade (command list, only prints commands that work from console)
   * /timedheal (bypasses cooldowns)
   * /timedhatch (bypasses cooldowns)

    Experimental command block support:
   * /fixgenders
   * /forcehatch
   * /forcestats
   * /timedheal (bypasses cooldowns, can be wired to do stuff like healing zones!)
   * /timedhatch (bypasses cooldowns, can be wired to automatically hatch whole teams)

    Other changes:
   * Added a fancy Unicode arrow ("➡") to /checktypes and the new /showstats hover mode.
   * Added a Mew clone count check to /checkstats and /showstats.
   * Added an alternate VIP cooldown to /showstats and the two new timed commands.
   * Added battle checks to many commands, as they can't work reliably during battles. Prevents wasted cooldowns.
   * Added Poipole (ID 803) and up to /checktypes and the new /spawndex.
   * Also, made Alolan Pokémon in /checktypes accessible through the less awkward "/checktypes Alolan NAMEHERE".
   * Changed many command messages to be a bit more professional.
   * Changed max-IV formatting for commands like /checkstats to italic to work around an external bug.
   * Changing command aliases no longer requires a reboot. Experimental.
   * Fixed /checkegg mentioning free rechecks when no price is set. It'll now continue silently.
   * Fixed /checkstats not showing the nickname on shiny Pokémon.
   * Fixed /checkstats's gender/size/nature line occasionally splitting into two? Hopefully THIS works.
   * Fixed /dittofusion mentioning upgrading instead of fusing in some places. Oops.
   * Fixed /resetcount not recognizing "ALL" correctly because I forgot I never fully finished it. Derp.
   * Fixed /upgradeivs saying legendaries were shiny on debug messages.
   * Fixed Ho-oh not working correctly in /checktypes.
   * Fixed main config not loading correctly if command configs were missing but a main config DID exist.
   * Fixed missing spaces in front of the pipes when showing EVs in /checkstats.
   * Fixed a bunch of other bugs that were too small to mention, mostly formatting issues.
   * Made /checkstats on eggs only refer to /checkegg if the player has its permissions. Still configurable.
   * Made names like "Tapu Koko" work in /checktypes.
   * Removed a few older internal aliases that weren't being shown anywhere anyways.
   * Removed baby IV checks from several commands, as Reforged updated to the gen6+ way of doing things.
   * Removed the chat printing option from /showstats, moved to a far cleaner and smaller setup using hovers.
   * Rewrote the internal config loader. Mostly helps maintainability, but filesize also benefits.
   * Shortened many console messages to fit a standard Windows Command Prompt window. Work in progress.
   * Switched to a #.#.# versioning system again (major/minor/patch) and started keeping proper changelogs!
