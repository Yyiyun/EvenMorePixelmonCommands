4.0.0 beta for 6.2.0+
Released ???

    Minor (non-breaking) config changes:
   * Changed a bunch of helper text to hopefully explain things a bit better.
   * Changed the default numLinesPerPage for /pixelupgrade from 20 to 10 to accomodate smaller chats.
   * Removed commandCost from /checktypes as this info is easily Googled.
   * Removed showFixEVsHelper from /checkstats as /fixevs was removed. See "Removed commands" for more info.
   * Removed per-config versions, as they turned out to be useless.

    Major (breaking) config changes:
   * New /showstats features: Super compact mode, and an alternate VIP cooldown. Regenerate this config.
   * New /upgradeivs features: Separate settings for shiny babies. Regenerate this config as well.

    New commands:
   * /fixgender: Fixes Pokémon affected by the 6.0.x breeding bug or by bad commands. Experimental!
   * /pokecure: Heals Pokémon (slot or party) on a configurable cooldown, for a configurable cost.
   * /spawndex: Spawns Pokémon based on their Pokédex number. Can add neat effects, like an outline.

    Removed commands:
   * /fixevs: As of Reforged 6.2, EVs cap at 252 (gen 6+ cap) instead of 255, making this command obsolete.
   * /fixlevel: The bug it was made to fix (EVs not increasing when at the level cap) no longer exists!

    Other changes:
   * Added Poipole (ID 803) and up to /checktypes and the new /spawndex.
   * Added an optional second argument to /checktypes, so names like "Tapu Koko" will work. Also fixed "Ho-Oh".
   * Added all babies and baby-based evolutions to /upgradeivs, and edited messages to fit.
   * Changed many command messages to be a bit more professional.
   * Changed max-IV formatting for commands like /checkstats to italic to work around an external bug.
   * Changing command aliases no longer requires a reboot. Experimental.
   * Experimental console support for: /checkstats, /checktypes, /fixgenders, /forcehatch, /forcestats, /pixelupgrade, /pokecure
   * Fixed /checkegg mentioning free rechecks when no price is set. It'll now continue silently.
   * Fixed /checkstats not showing the nickname on shiny Pokémon.
   * Fixed /checkstats's gender/size/nature line occasionally splitting into two? Hopefully THIS works.
   * Fixed /dittofusion mentioning upgrading instead of fusing in some places. Oops.
   * Fixed /resetcount not recognizing "ALL" correctly because I forgot I never fully finished it. Derp.
   * Fixed /upgradeivs saying legendaries were shiny on debug messages.
   * Fixed main config not loading correctly if command configs were missing but a main config DID exist.
   * Fixed missing spaces in front of the pipes when showing EVs in /checkstats.
   * Fixed a bunch of other bugs that were too small to mention, mostly formatting issues.
   * Removed a few older default aliases that weren't being shown anywhere anyways.
   * Rewrote the internal config loader. Mostly helps maintainability, but filesize also benefits.
   * Shortened many console messages to fit a standard Windows Command Prompt window. Work in progress.
   * Switched to a #.#.# versioning system (major/minor/patch) and started keeping proper changelogs!
